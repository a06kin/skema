# Skema

Skema is a test execution framework for OpenMAX IL components. It is the main
test tool used to develop and verify the OpenMAX IL plugins used in
[Tizonia](http://github.com/tizonia/tizonia-openmax-il/).

Skema is written in Python and the tests cases are scripted using an
[easy-to-write XML
syntax](http://github.com/tizonia/tizonia-openmax-il/wiki/Mp3Playback101).

Skema's XML syntax provides an extensible language for scripting OpenMAX IL
graphs and their behaviours.

For information on how to use Skema, run existing tests, implement new tests,
or extend Skema's XML syntax and behaviour, go to the wiki pages in Tizonia's
main repo: https://github.com/tizonia/tizonia-openmax-il/wiki/Skema
